# Community Involvement

![Scrimshaw Community Mealshare](media/Distro.jpg){width="800"}

Outside of my professional career, involvement in my local community is equally as important in my opinion. I am heavily involved in disability activism and advocacy through a group called Cripple Punk Alliance. One regular event we hold is a weekly community mealshare, where people who are unhoused or in-need in other ways are able to come get a hot meal, some clean clothes, vital supplies, and have a safe place to relax and talk with their community.
