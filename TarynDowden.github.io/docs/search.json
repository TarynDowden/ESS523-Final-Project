This project also serve as the topic of my thesis for my MS program. The overarching goal of the project includes developing a standardized and comprehensive 3D fuels database derived from in situ and airborne remote sensing data, and use these data sets to calibrate and validate LANDFIRE’s core fuels metrics at a national scale on a subannual basis, and to develop workflows to properly characterize the spatio-temporal uncertainties in these fuels estimates. My portion of the project involves relating existing ALS data to forest canopy fuel predictions."

    "text": "Rocky Mountain Research Station\nMy previous field experience comes from my time working with USFS Rocky Mountain Research Center as a research technician. I worked with Research Scientists Mike Battaglia and Wade Tinkham on a variety of different projects. Field work included completing fixed radius plots mapping trees and recording height and diameter, as well as evaluation vegetation and fuel characteristics. I evaluated vegetation cover and fuel photoloads, collecting destructive fuels samples to bring back to the lab for developing a correction curve for these estimates. This data was used for managing fuel treatments in different ecosystems and to provide ground-truthing for the development of UAS Structure-from-Motion models."

    "text": "My experience growing up in the wildland urban interface outside of Colorado Springs, Colorado shaped my love for and interest in the natural world. I spent the majority of my childhood outside in a ponderosa pine forest in Black Forest, an unincorporated area to the northeast of the Springs. In 2013, a fire came through this area, burning down my family’s home along with around 500 other structures. I saw firsthand how the legacy of fire exclusion, forest mismanagement, and climate change impacts people first hand, and the inequal way these impacts are felt across different socioeconomic groups. These experiences drove my interest in fire science as well as climate justice.\nI completed my undergraduate degree at Colorado State University in Forest and Rangeland Stewardship in Spring of 2025. During this time, I worked for the USFS as a Forestry Research Technician and Biogeochemical Lab Technician, gaining experience in both a field and laboratory setting. I also participated in the campus chapter of the Society of American Foresters, serving as the very first Diversity and Outreach Chair for the club.\nStarting in Fall 2025, I am pursuing a Masters degree in Forest Sciences as a member of the Francis Forest Ecology Lab. Here, I am working on a project with a larger group using Aerial LIDAR to characterize forest structure in order to model potential fire behavior across different ecosystems."

I am heavily involved in disability activism and advocacy through a group called Cripple Punk Alliance. One regular event we hold is a weekly community mealshare, where people who are unhoused or in-need in other ways are able to come get a hot meal, some clean clothes, vital supplies, and have a safe place to relax and talk with their community. We meet at Scrimshaw Tattoo every Friday from 4pm to 6pm!"
