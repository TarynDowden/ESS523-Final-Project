# Rocky Mountain Research Station

My previous field experience comes from my time working with USFS Rocky Mountain Research Center as a research technician. I worked with Research Scientists Mike Battaglia and Wade Tinkham on a variety of different projects. Field work included completing fixed radius plots mapping trees and recording height and diameter, as well as evaluation vegetation and fuel characteristics. I evaluated vegetation cover and fuel photoloads, collecting destructive fuels samples to bring back to the lab for developing a correction curve for these estimates. This data was used for managing fuel treatments in different ecosystems and to provide ground-truthing for the development of UAS Structure-from-Motion models.
